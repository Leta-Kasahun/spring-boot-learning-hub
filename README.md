# spring-boot-learning-hub
A structured and practical learning hub for mastering Spring Boot ‚Äî covering REST APIs, JPA, security, testing, and deployment with real-world examples and clean architecture.
üå± Simple Spring Boot Learning Roadmap
üß© Phase 1: Basics

Goal: Learn what Spring Boot is and how it works.

Learn basic Java (OOP, exceptions, streams).

Understand Maven or Gradle (to manage dependencies).

Learn core Spring annotations: @Component, @Autowired, @Configuration.

Understand @SpringBootApplication and how auto-configuration works.

Use application.properties or application.yml for settings.
Mini Project: Create a simple REST API with /hello endpoint.

üåê Phase 2: Web Development

Goal: Build REST APIs with Spring MVC.

Learn @RestController, @GetMapping, @PostMapping.

Handle JSON data using Jackson.

Validate requests with @Valid, @NotNull.

Handle errors using @ControllerAdvice.
Mini Project: Build a simple User API with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

üíæ Phase 3: Database Integration

Goal: Connect your app to a database.

Learn Spring Data JPA.

Use @Entity, @Id, and JpaRepository.

Practice with H2 database first, then PostgreSQL.

Understand relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).

Learn @Transactional for managing database changes.
Mini Project: Store and retrieve users from a database.

üîê Phase 4: Security and Monitoring

Goal: Secure and monitor your app.

Learn Spring Security basics.

Add authentication and authorization.

Use Actuator to monitor app health.

Create separate environments (dev, test, prod).
Mini Project: Add login and role-based access to your API.

üöÄ Phase 5: Advanced Features

Goal: Make your app production-ready.

Learn AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) for logging.

Use scheduling (@Scheduled) and async tasks (@Async).

Add caching to speed up performance.

‚òÅÔ∏è Phase 6: Microservices and Cloud

Goal: Build and deploy scalable apps.

Learn Spring Cloud (Config Server, Gateway, Eureka).

Use OpenFeign or RestTemplate for service communication.


Mini Project: Build a small system with multiple Spring Boot microservices working together.

üå± Spring Boot Essential Annotations ‚Äî Quick Reference
@SpringBootApplication

Main entry point for a Spring Boot application.

Combines @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.

@RestController

Marks a class as a RESTful controller.

Combines @Controller and @ResponseBody for JSON/XML responses.

@RequestMapping

Maps HTTP requests to handler methods or classes.

Specialized forms: @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping.

@PathVariable

Binds a URI template variable to a method parameter.

@RequestParam

Extracts query parameters from the URL.

@RequestBody

Maps the body of an HTTP request to a method parameter (usually a POJO).

@Service

Marks a class as a service component containing business logic.

@Repository

Marks a class as a data access component.

Enables Spring‚Äôs exception translation for database operations.

@Autowired

Injects bean dependencies automatically (recommended via constructor injection).

@Configuration

Indicates a class contains Spring bean definitions.

@Bean

Declares a method that returns a Spring-managed bean.

@Entity

Marks a class as a JPA entity mapped to a database table.

@Id

Denotes the primary key field of an entity.

@GeneratedValue

Defines how primary keys are generated (e.g., AUTO, IDENTITY).

@Table

Specifies the database table name for an entity.

@Valid

Enables validation of method parameters or request bodies using Java Bean Validation.

@NotNull, @Email, etc.

Common validation annotations for fields in model classes.

@CrossOrigin

Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for APIs accessed by front-end apps.

@SpringBootTest

Loads the complete Spring application context for integration testing.
