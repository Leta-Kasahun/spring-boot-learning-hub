# spring-boot-learning-hub
A structured and practical learning hub for mastering Spring Boot ‚Äî covering REST APIs, JPA, security, testing, and deployment with real-world examples and clean architecture.
üå± Simple Spring Boot Learning Roadmap
üß© Phase 1: Basics

Goal: Learn what Spring Boot is and how it works.

Learn basic Java (OOP, exceptions, streams).

Understand Maven or Gradle (to manage dependencies).

Learn core Spring annotations: @Component, @Autowired, @Configuration.

Understand @SpringBootApplication and how auto-configuration works.

Use application.properties or application.yml for settings.
Mini Project: Create a simple REST API with /hello endpoint.

üåê Phase 2: Web Development

Goal: Build REST APIs with Spring MVC.

Learn @RestController, @GetMapping, @PostMapping.

Handle JSON data using Jackson.

Validate requests with @Valid, @NotNull.

Handle errors using @ControllerAdvice.
Mini Project: Build a simple User API with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

üíæ Phase 3: Database Integration

Goal: Connect your app to a database.

Learn Spring Data JPA.

Use @Entity, @Id, and JpaRepository.

Practice with H2 database first, then MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Understand relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).

Learn @Transactional for managing database changes.
Mini Project: Store and retrieve users from a database.

üîê Phase 4: Security and Monitoring

Goal: Secure and monitor your app.

Learn Spring Security basics.

Add authentication and authorization.

Use Actuator to monitor app health.

Create separate environments (dev, test, prod).
Mini Project: Add login and role-based access to your API.

üöÄ Phase 5: Advanced Features

Goal: Make your app production-ready.

Learn AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) for logging.

Use scheduling (@Scheduled) and async tasks (@Async).

Add caching to speed up performance.

Dockerize your app.

Write tests using JUnit and Mockito.
Mini Project: Dockerize and test your API.

‚òÅÔ∏è Phase 6: Microservices and Cloud

Goal: Build and deploy scalable apps.

Learn Spring Cloud (Config Server, Gateway, Eureka).

Use OpenFeign or RestTemplate for service communication.

Learn CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins).

Understand basic Kubernetes concepts.
Mini Project: Build a small system with multiple Spring Boot microservices working together.
